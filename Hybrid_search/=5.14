INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of langchain-neo4j to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested langchain-core==0.3.52
    langchain-community 0.3.21 depends on langchain-core<1.0.0 and >=0.3.51
    langchain-neo4j 0.7.0 depends on langchain-core<2.0.0 and >=1.0.0

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    langchain-core

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
